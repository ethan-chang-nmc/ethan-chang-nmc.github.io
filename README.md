## Ethan Chang's Personal Webpage

about: A static website coded by yours truly as a personal website to showcase some things about me, for the Harvard CS50 course. The file index.html contains the HTML code for this one-page site, styles.css with the styling choices in CSS, and script.js containing the javascript elements. The logos used were all downloaded from official websites following their copyright laws. All other files are photos used within the website.

I settled on a single webpage as a design to keep a fluid-flowing user experience. I played with having multiple web pages but did not like how the decreased content limited my stylistic choices. I took inspiration from Appleâ€™s clean, modern-looking website and their box design used for product promotions for my images. I also liked the sectioning of content from the sites of Nvidia and Blackrock and took that as inspiration for the skeleton of the website. <br/>
As a big fan of the parallax effect, I knew I wanted to incorporate it into my website. This would also allow me to incorporate background images that encapsulated the main areas of focus of my professional interests. I also had to use JavaScript to make sure the section would disappear after scrolling past it. I knew I wanted to have the About section following the hero section, and took inspiration from basic About sections from companies. A more personable website (while still being professional) was desired, so I decided to add a section of images (which was made so that they are enlarged when clicking on them) to achieve this effect. I then knew I wanted a second parallax section breaking the About section from my portfolio, with links to contact me at the footer. From this, the main design of the website was laid out. From the stylistic advice of some friends, I shifted to a pure black background with white text and a quote in the second parallax section that I felt embodied a part of my mindset.

While the main design of the website was set, using the website still felt like some things were missing. Here, I began browsing through other websites to find minor stylistic changes that would make a big difference. I first made it so the header bar would stay on top while scrolling down. Then, I settled on a simple but effective flipping effect for the hero section to draw attention to the site while keeping a clean, techy look. Additionally, I played with multiple ways for the quote to come in and eventually settled on a fading in effect. This effect was achieved with Javascript, and it is worth noting that it took a lot of pondering to finally figure out that adding a blur was what I needed to achieve the desired effect! 

Since I am focused on research, having my publications and presentations at the top was important, followed by any projects that I would complete. It was here that I realized that while I had kept everything centered, I hadnâ€™t aligned my text to justify (as the side edges produce a cleaner look), so I changed that. The publications and presentation were simple to list - however, I debated how I would go about showcasing my projects. I settled with descriptors where clicking on them would lead to the described project as the most minimalistic, clean look possible. Additionally, I thought it would be a better idea to link my most updated CV as well for a more comprehensive look at my background and achievements rather than cluttering the space with word vomit.

Finally, I had to decide how I wanted to implement the contact section. Initially, I had thought about implementing a contact box for people to fill in information. However, I would still have to have icons linking to important socials (i.e. Linkedin, ORCID, etc.) I felt like incorporating the contact as an icon would be best. Additionally, although I have seen other websites use contact boxes, I have not used a single site where it did not seem out of place/clunky, which would go against the aesthetic of my website. Therefore, I used a minimalistic line, with the icons on top and the copyright on the bottom to satisfy all my requirements, resulting in a website that I am proud of!
